# Data CRUD

Author: <!-- TODO: Change author name -->

Write queries for example data. Choose **your own subject**. Write queries for the following actions:

* Creation of a database
* Usage of that new database
* Create a table (choose the correct datatypes for the different columns) with minimum 4 columns
* Insert a single row of data in the table
* Insert minimum 5 rows of data in the table (using a single query command)
* Add an extra attribute (column) to your table
* Show all column names with there properties (column names, datatype,...)
* Update minimum 1 row where you insert a new value to the newly created column
* Delete a row from your table
* Show all data from the table

If you have no idea's about the subject, you could create your database around: cars, plants, computers, graphics cards, microcontrollers, invoices, students, exams, ...

## Create database query

Give a query that creates a new database. Choose your own subject, and choose a meaningful corresponding name for your database.

```sql

```

## Use database query

Give a query that will set the default database to your newly created database. This way, future queries will be run in the context of that database.

```sql

```

## Create table query

Give a query that will create a new table that you will use to manage some data covering your chosen subject. Choose a meaningful name for this table.
Provide minimum 4 columns for your table. Make sure to choose the correct datatypes for the different properties.

Add an extra row that is called `id` that will be set as *primary key*, and will be *auto incremented*.

```sql

```

## Insert a single row

Give a query that wil insert a single row into your newly create table. Pick some realistic data, try not to insert some nonsense. Do not insert the `id` attribute manually, but let the database decide a value.

```sql

```

## Insert multiple rows at once

Give a query that will insert multiple rows at once. Only provide a single query that inserts minimum 5 rows. Again do not provide an `id` attribute yourself.

```sql

```

## Add an extra column to the table

Choose an extra attribute to add to the table. Give a query that will make this change to your table.

```sql

```

## Show all the columns and their properties

Give a query that will show all column names with there properties (column names, datatype,...). Copy paste the result from powershell in your answer as well.

```sql

```

Result:

```text

```

## Updating existing rows

Give a query that will update minimum 1 row where you insert a new value to the newly created column.

```sql

```

## Delete a row from your table

Choose a row (one that you did not update in previous question) and give a query that will delete that single row.

```sql

```

## Show all data from the table

Give a query that will show your entire table with all the columns and all its data. It's important that the data will reflect all previous executed queries. Copy paste the result from powershell in your answer as well.

```sql

```

Result:

```text

```
